## Prerequisites

To complete this, you will need:

- A local development environment for JavaScript
- **Node.js** (v20.x or later) and **npm** (v6.x or later) installed. You can follow
  [How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-install-node-js-and-create-a-local-development-environment)
  guide.
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Initialize Your Project

First, navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal. If you don't have a project set up
yet, you can create one using the following commands:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
npm init -y
```

You'll see the following output:

```
Wrote to /path/to/my-project/package.json:

{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

# About docs

This repository provides a standardized and reusable GitHub Actions workflow setup inspired by
Vercel’s Styleguide. The setup includes three primary workflows designed to enhance your project’s
CI/CD pipeline:

1. [Release Workflow](Release.md): Automates the release process, including versioning, changelog
   generation, and pull request creation.
2. [Code Quality Workflow](Code-Quality.md): Ensures code consistency and quality through automated
   linting and formatting checks.
3. [Writerside Documentation Workflow](Writerside.md): Builds and deploys project documentation
   using Docker-based builders.

# Kurocado Studio Style Guide

This repository contains the style guide for our project, specifically tailored for TypeScript. We
have used the [Vercel Style Guide](https://github.com/vercel/style-guide) as a base for our
TypeScript configurations, and aspire to maintain the same high standards in our code quality. We
extend our thanks to [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/style-guide) for open-sourcing their
styleguide
